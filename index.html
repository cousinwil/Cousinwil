          <p class="white"><a href="http://github.com/cousinwil/eeze" class="red">Eeze</a> is a clean slate for professional developers creating custom applications. eeze.min.css comes out of the box at under 6K (BEFORE G-Zipping &amp; you can gain ~2k by swapping to the HTML5 Reset) and sets up a great LESS workflow.</p>
          <p class="white">Unlike Twitter Bootstrap, Eeze comes as a minimal starting point for your app. I’ve only included the most common building blocks and base file structure that you might need to create a custom application. There are no base preset styles to work around, delete, or overwrite. Just clone the app and start writing *your* code in seconds.</p>

          <p class="gold">Perhaps even more pride inducing is the front-end talent that I interviewed, pitched, and helped bring on to Yammer.
