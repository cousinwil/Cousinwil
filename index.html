        <p class="white"><a href="http://github.com/cousinwil/eeze" class="red">Eeze</a> is the logical conclusion of my older project, St.eeze. It uses HTML5 and LESS to deliver a clean slate from which to build a modern application front end. Unlike Twitter Bootstrap, Eeze comes as a clean slate. Included are the barest building blocks and base file structure one might need to create a custom application. There are no base colors or styles, no javascript includes. Just a great clean slate from which to start.</p>

        <p class="white">Powder Envy is a project that I’ve had in my back pocket for a long time. One day the idea for the gondola visualization just hit me out of the blue. I sketched it up in my moleskine and emailed it to my pal, Tom. After that things started moving quickly. I suddenly found myself with this very striking center-piece, and that made everything that much more fun to make!</p>

        <p class="white">When Zivity and Top Fans (now Bubble Fusion Labs) split up, I styaed with Zivity.and immediately started work on a new home page design intended to overcome longstanding problems converting new users while signaling to the ones we had that there was more to come. After a great response, the new design was spread to the rest of the site and Zivity got a new Showcase to direct people to the editors’ favorite content. We added credit card processing, tagging, prizes, fixed endless bugs, and over the course of 7 months we doubled our 18 month-old subscriber base!</p>

        <p class="white">Top Fans was fun because it was a chance for us to work on a brand new application and develop it right from the ground up. It was by far the best development team that Zivity had during the two years I worked there. In no time at all the site was conceptualized, developed, designed, and launched. Over the next few months we made countless improvements and fun-to-develop features like a posterous-style handler of video, audio, and images from blackberries, iphones, etc.</p>

        <p class="white">Working for Zivity was a charmed life for many reasons. Zivity was my first Rails development job and my first "mainstream" (Silicon Valley VC funded) start-up. My first day at Zivity Forbes was in the office. A couple days after Zivity was prominent at “the Crunchies,” two months later we were funded. And, all the while, I got to work with some really great people making some really cool stuff.</p>
        <p class="white">I was hired January of 2008 as a Web Developer. In July of 2008 I was promoted to Sr. UI Engineer. In April of 2009 Zivity became Top Fans, of which I was a SR UI Engineer until the companies split in July. At that time I became the UI Architect and Community Advocate of Zivity.</p>
